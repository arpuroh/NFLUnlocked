    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A responsive dashboard layout is used to present the draft analysis. A persistent, clickable ranked list of teams on the left (or top on mobile) acts as the primary navigation. Selecting a team dynamically updates a main content area with that team's detailed report card. This structure was chosen because it allows users to easily switch between a high-level league overview and an in-depth analysis of individual teams without losing context. Below this, a dedicated section for league-wide visualizations provides comparative insights into spending strategies and overall draft value, making the data highly explorable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Team Report Cards -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Method: Styled HTML cards with dynamic JS content updates -> Interaction: Click from team list to display. Justification: Clear, digestible format for qualitative analysis. | Spending vs. Grade Chart -> Goal: Relationships -> Method: Chart.js Scatter Plot -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Visually correlates spending efficiency with draft success. | Positional Spending Chart -> Goal: Compare/Organize -> Method: Chart.js Stacked Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Instantly reveals different team-building strategies. | Top Spenders Chart -> Goal: Inform -> Method: Chart.js Horizontal Bar -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Highlights the draft's most significant investments. All charts use Canvas via Chart.js. -->
